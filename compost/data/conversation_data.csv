"[16:04,13/04/2024]", GreenThumb (Garden Gurus),Why are there magoots in my compost bin??,Question,,
"[16:05, 13/04/2024", EarthyEssence (Eco Enthusiast)," Hey there! Maggots can sometimes appear in compost bins if the conditions are right. First, try to identify what might be attracting them. It could be overly moist conditions or certain types of food scraps. Remove any visible maggots and adjust your composting mix to make it less appealing to them. Adding more dry carbon-rich materials like shredded paper or cardboard can help balance out the moisture and discourage maggots from sticking around. Keep an eye on the moisture levels and avoid overfeeding the bin to prevent future infestations.",Answer,,
